## My process
- Tried to experience some stuff while watching [coder coder's](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) tutorial on how she usually approach projects. I started by taking notes, like what she did in her video and tried to research some useful stuff that could help me with the project. I've also tried the mobile-first workflow. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Gulp
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned how to approach a project more clearly and organise stuff to maximize the productivity while coding. I really love working with gulp, and its plugins. I've also learn how to use the `clamp` property for css and also tried to use the BEM approach for this project. 

```css
.learn-btn {
  font-size: clamp(14px, 3vw, 18px);
}
```
### Continued development

I'm still trying to improve myself working with mobile-first workflow.

### Useful resources

- [Resource #1](https://kinsta.com/blog/responsive-web-design/#set-your-media-query-ranges-responsive-breakpoints) - This helped me for being more comfortable with setting responsive breakpoints for a project.
